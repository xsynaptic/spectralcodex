# OpenGraph Image Generator

This package contains some code sketching out an implementation of an Open Graph image generator for Astro using Vercel's [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori). Some references consulted while hammering out this as-yet unused prototype:

- [this post](https://snorre.io/blog/2023-09-08-generating-opengraph-images-for-astro-copy/) detailing a plugin-based approach
- [another post](https://techsquidtv.com/blog/generating-open-graph-images-for-astro/) for some discussion of build time image path issues
- [this playground](https://og-playground.vercel.app/) for further developing image element style
- [this repo](https://github.com/delucis/astro-og-canvas/tree/latest/packages/astro-og-canvas) for some direction on image caching
