# Astro workspace standards

- This Astro project uses pnpm workspaces mainly for keeping code clean and isolating some specialized functionality that might rely on many dependencies
- New dependencies should almost certainly be `devDependencies`

# Package isolation standards

- Do not import anything from the main Astro project when modifying code under `packages`; due to the way the Astro build process works (via Vite/Rollup) this can cause errors later on
- Duplicate necessary types locally in workspace packages
- Document the duplication with a comment explaining the source
- Keep duplicated code minimal and focused
